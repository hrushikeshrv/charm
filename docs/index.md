# Charm
This document describes how to work with the chess-playing
robotic arm and how to recreate it yourself. It provides
the following resources -

- CAD files (.stp) files that were used to design the parts for the robot
- [Documentation for `chessengine`](https://chessengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest), the chess engine built to find moves for the arm
- Documentation for how to use stockfish with the arm instead of the default `chessengine`
- Arduino code to control the motion of the arm
- Circuit schematic for connecting the arm to the Arduino
- Circuit schematic for building a custom chess board that detects moves made and communicates with the Arduino
