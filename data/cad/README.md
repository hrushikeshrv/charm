# Charm CAD Files
This directory provides the 3D models that I used to 3D print the parts for this project. There are different folders for `.stp` files and for `.ipt` files (since I used Autodesk Inventor to design the parts for this project).

The `step/` directory contains all the parts that you will need to get 3D printed (or manufactured some other way if you choose), and the `inventor` directory contains the original Autodesk Inventor part files as well as the assembly files that show you how to assemble the arm. 

<!-- TODO - also provide the assembly files as .stp in the inventor/ directory -->

Specifically, you will need to get the following parts manufactured -

1. arm-bar-1.stp
2. arm-bar-2.stp
3. arm-base-axel-support.stp
4. arm-base.stp
5. gripper-arm-connector-1.stp
6. gripper-arm-connector-2.stp
7. gripper-arm-connector-axis.stp
8. gripper-arm.stp
9. gripper-connector-frame-axis.stp
10. gripper-frame-cover.stp
11. gripper-frame.stp
12. gripper-screw-sleeve.stp
13. gripper-sleeve-arm-connector.stp
