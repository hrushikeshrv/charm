# Charm CAD Files
This directory provides the 3D models that I used to 3D print the parts for this project. There are different folders for `.stp` files and for `.ipt` files (since I used Autodesk Inventor to design the parts for this project).

I took most of the design for this arm from [this article by HowToMechatronics](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/diy-arduino-robot-arm-with-smartphone-control/).

The `step/` directory contains all the `.stp` files that you will need to get 3D printed, and the `inventor/` directory contains the original Autodesk Inventor part files as well as the assembly files that show you how to assemble the arm.

Specifically, you will need to get the following parts 3D printed -

| File | Copies |
|------|--------|
| `Waist.stp` | 1 |
| `Base.stp` | 1 |
| `Arm 01-large.stp` | 1 |
| `Arm 02-large.stp` | 1 |
| `grip link 1.stp` | 4 |
| `Gripper base.stp` | 1 |
| `Gripper 1.stp` | 2 |
| `gear1.stp` | 1 |
| `gear2.stp` | 1 |
